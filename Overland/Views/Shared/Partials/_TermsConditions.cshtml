    <p><i>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</i></p>
  <p>You have the right to request New Haven disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <i>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</i>), we will disclose to you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
        <li> Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
        <li> The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
        <li> The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
        <li> If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</li>
        <ul class="square">
          <li> Sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
          <li> Disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <i>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</i><br/>
    To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
    <ul>
        <li> Emailing us at info@newhavenfinancial.com
    </ul>
    Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
    You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
    <ul>
        <li> Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
        <li> Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
    </ul>
    We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
    Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password-protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.
    We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
